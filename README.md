# turtlesim_shapes
Hello there!
In this project, I have used custom rosservice to draw shape with integer as input to draw respective shape designated to that integer

### Problem statement 

the problem statement that i took to myself was to write a code to draw triangle-rectangle-circle instead of using terminal input, create a custom service(**srv**) which has int datatype as *request* and String datatype as *response*
and that string will correspond to the shape.
