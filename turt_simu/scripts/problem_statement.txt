 -  write a code to draw triangle-rectangle-circle instead of using terminal input, create  a custom service(srv) 
 - which has int datatype as request and String datatype as response
 - string will correspond to shape
 
 TIP - You can use the draw_shapes.py file to import it as module to use the functions of the shapes.
